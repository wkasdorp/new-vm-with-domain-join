# Create new VMs and join them to an existing AD domain

This template creates one or more new VMs and joins them to an 
existing AD domain, using an existing VNET and existing storage account. 
The AD domain must have connectivity to the VNET. 
The DNS definitions on the VNET will inherit to the VMs and _must_ enable
the new VMs to resolve the AD domain. Also, your AD DNS must be able to 
resolve the public internet.

Warning: this template **creates one or more running VMs**. 
Make sure to deallocate it when you are done to avoid incurring costs. 

The existing VNET and Storage Groups can be in different Resource Groups. 
This enables a neat trick: after you are done with the VMs you can remove
 the entire RG and its contents in one shot, 
instead of having to pick the resources from the existing RG one by one. 

The VMs are deliberately created without public NICs. They already
have internal connectivity, so use that to open RDP connections etc.
Your VNET must allow internet access for the VMs. 

The template, unusually, does not ask for the administrator name 
and password for the new VMs. This is because the VMs will 
be joined to a domain and the local Admin account is not needed.
The password is obfuscated but not random. For increased security
you need to set it yourself.
